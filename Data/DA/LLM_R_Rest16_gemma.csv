The price of this restaurant was very expensive for what they gave me on my plate - fish that could've come out any other day with its flavor being so low quality! It reminded me more about how much money has gone into buying groceries than actual food.,salmon,negative
It was disappointing that my first experience with this restaurant's food resulted in such dryness for both myself personally - which made me want more than just something else but also on average too much fish overall!.,salmon,negative
